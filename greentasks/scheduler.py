    """
    A very simple task scheduler built on top of gevent.

    Allows scheduling of periodic, one-off delayed and one-off ordered tasks.

    Periodic tasks will run repeatedly after their execution in the specified
    amount of time.

    One-off delayed tasks are executed only once after the specified delay has
    passed.

    One-off ordered tasks are put into a queue and are executed in the same
    order they were scheduled. The queue is processed in fixed intervals which
    is specified by the ``consume_tasks_delay`` parameter in the constructor of
    the scheduler. In each wakeup, exactly one task will be processed.

    Failing tasks are retried if the task implementation allows to do so.

        Schedule a task for execution and return a packaged task object for it.

        ``task`` may be any callable and it should contain the task logic. If
        ``task`` is a subclass of py:class:`Task`, the parameters ``delay``,
        ``periodic``, ``retry_delay`` and ``max_retries`` will be ignored in
        favor of the ones defined on the class itself.

        ``args`` and ``kwargs`` contain the positional and keyword arguments to
        be passed to ``task``.

        ``callback`` and ``errback`` are callables to be invoked with the
        return value of ``task`` or the exception object raised if ``task``
        fails, respectively.

        ``delay`` is the amount of seconds in which ``task`` should be
        executed. If ``delay`` is not specified, the task will be put into a
        queue and honor the existing order of scheduled tasks, being executed
        only after the tasks scheduled prior to it are finished. If ``delay``
        is specified, the task will be scheduled to run NOT BEFORE the
        specified amount of seconds, not following any particular order, but
        there is no guarantee that it will run in exactly that time.

        The ``periodic`` flag has effect only on tasks which specified a
        ``delay``, and those tasks will be rescheduled automatically for the
        same ``delay`` every time after they are executed (unless ``task`` is
        a subclass of py:class:`Task` and it implemented custom rules to
        calculate the value of ``delay``.

        ``retry_delay`` is the amount of seconds in which ``task`` can be
        retried, in case it fails. The value of ``None`` prohibits retries.

        ``max_retires`` is the maximum number of retry attempts for a failing
        task.
